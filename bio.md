![The Band](/images/the_band.jpg)

Distorted Decade was formed by current members Karl Thompson, Luke Girvan, and Tim Woodgates.

With an extensive musical background behind them all quality and energy were the focus from the start.

Luke has performed at venues across the UK showcasing his unique style of original music, including many o2 shows, alongside providing guitar for various artists in the studio and on tour.

Karl and Luke met when Luke needed a drummer for one of his tours. With a long history of touring under his belt, working with many tribute artists and original artists alike, Karl's most notable achievement is performing worldwide with prestigious show band Poison Ivy for the last 15 years, supporting many hit bands from the 60's, 70's & 80's.

After deciding that a function band needed to be formed they drafted in Tim, a good friend of Luke's, Tim has worked with a variety of bands and toured across Europe.
